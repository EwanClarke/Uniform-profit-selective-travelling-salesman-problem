# The Uniform Profit Travelling Salesman Problem

The Selective Travelling Salesman Problem is a variation of the travelling salesman problem which restricts the maximum traversal cost and assigns each node a profit, not requiring that every node be visited.
The goal is changed from a shortest traversal of all nodes to a maximisation of total profit, selecting nodes and edges which will be the most profitable.
This project implements algorithms for a variant of this algorithm removing the profit constraint, instead focussing on the maximisation of nodes in the tour.
